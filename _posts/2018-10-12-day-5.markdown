# Day 5
Freecodecamp again.  Finished Accessibility and Responsive web design moduldes.  Looking forward to flex / grid this weekend.  Again, not much coding but this weekend should be fun.  

#### Weekend Todos (hopefully)  
Flex & Grid Modules  
Finish some sort of landing page, basic AF  
Maybe add a module to the kids game I've been working on (Angular)
